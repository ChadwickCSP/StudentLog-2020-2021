Logging off. When I added in 3 more varibles, I ended up making 4 new rooms in my quest to expand my adventure. I then ended up making tests for 4 other endings because I realized the endings I had were generilzed, for example, I had one ending as just death when in reality, there were multiple different ways to die. So, I made tests for more than 2 other endings and then explained what those tests were for.
