Singing on. I ended up having to run some last minute errands but I'm back now trying to work on making a dot move around for milestone 4.

- [x] Spend some time fooling with the redshift homebrew 

Singing off. I actually ended up figuring out how to make my own bot move up and down according to what part of the toggle you hold down, which was pretty much my goal for milestone 4. I don't want to turn it in quite yet because I want to make sure I have done what I need to do to get credit for the game-creation portion.
